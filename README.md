## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The use of flex. I was able to place elements easily with flex. With more projects I will be able to master flex and grid. 

### Continued development

In the next projects I will try to focus on flex and grid. Always trying to implement complex solutions where I can do the same thing with the simple usage of flex and grid.
